## Overview
This is an app called TouchGrass (the name is subject to change). The aim of the app is to allow users to create and track their habits in a fun way, encouraging them to take activities outside of the online world. 

Go TouchGrass is the motto and will change what the meaning of go touch grass is. 

## Functionality
The core functionality will be users being able to set habits they want to work on and a target frequency. The idea is to take a picture of you doing that activity and upload it to the app to keep a visual log of completing the activities. You can upload a picture at any time despite the frequency. Depending on the frequency, you will get a notification to do that activity if you have not uploaded an image from the last time you uploaded it. You can add a note or caption to each image. 

Users can add friends and be updated when their friends upload a photo.

You can login using google, apple and you can set your own unique username.
